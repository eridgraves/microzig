[PRERELEASE] HALs and register definitions for TM4C123X (TEVA) devices

== What version of Zig to use

0.11.0

== TM4C123X boards that renode supports:

- LaunchPad Eval Kit (TM4C123GXL) (TIVA C Series): https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL
- [FUTURE] LaunchPad Eval Kit (TM4C129EXL) (TIVA C Series): https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C129EXL 

== TODO

- Add src/hals files
- Add src/chips files (see below)
- TI doesn't publish SVD files for the TM4C Series. 
    - Need to go in /src/chips/
    - TI forum post https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/arm-based-microcontrollers-group/arm-based-microcontrollers/f/arm-based-microcontrollers-forum/354937/tiva-c-series-svd-files 
    - These need to be generated/translated from debug headers released in Energia. 
    - Possibly using this tool https://github.com/m-labs/dslite2svd 
- Finish tests
